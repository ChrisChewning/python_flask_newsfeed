This project was a personal challenge to create something I would use each day, on my laptop or mobile.

The idea came about as I got more into Python and was reading on Reddit about projects people had done. I really was interested in 
aggregation and how to make the internet work for you better. Along those same lines, I liked the idea of something that saved me time instead 
of me wasting time online.


I really like Django but Flask offered more of a do-it-yourself challenge. It had less built-in ready code. Beautiful Soup was really fun to use
and SQLAlchmy was good overall. I had to work through some migration issues with it and then with deployment incompatabilities with Heroku. 

I am happy with the final product but see a lot of room for improvement.
